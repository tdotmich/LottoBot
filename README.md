# LottoBot

The app can be accessed through a private link, as Anvil hosting is rather expensive for just a single application.

The app was built from scratch using Python, and was originally just a local .py file, however I wanted to make it accessible for others without them having to install Python on their machine. It uses Anvil for hosting, and the only libraries used is 'Random'. This is just a fun project to help me get improve my Python skills.

The other file in this directory is the raw .py file I made but then modified to suit Anvil.
